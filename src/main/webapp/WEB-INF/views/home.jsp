				Hi Mom!  The ORCA project (OpenSource Rapid Comparative Analysis)
				provides free tools to evaluate software in a consistent and efficient manner.  Using
				10 proven software metrics, ORCA will help you evaluate every aspect of an open 
				source project.  ORCA also allows software teams to corroborate on multiple projects with ease.  
				Take the risk out of using open source software by helping your organization evaluate 
				it in an objective and consistent manner.  Software evaluations can be setup in minutes 
				and of course our tool is 100% free.

				<h2>software selection simplied</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Despite the fact that open source projects are plentiful, selecting the right software to use for 
				your next project can be challenging.  Common questions include:
				<ul>
					<li>What features does this software provide?</li>
					<li>Will it perform under heavy load?</li>
					<li>Does this project have adequate documentation and an activity user community?</li>
					<li>Will this project still be active in the future?</li>
				</ul>
				The ORCA tool coverts these questions into 10 reliable software metrics which can be
				weighted to fit your projects individual needs.  These metrics are based on graduate
				level research from Penn State University and an article in the 
				<i>International Journal of Strategic Information Technology and Applications</i>

				<h2>Do I need an account?</h2>
				<p>Nope.  If you are in a hurry and want to start your evaluation,
				there is no need to setup an account.  You can easily reference 
				your evaluation with links that we provide.  Just keep
				in mind, however, that evaluations without an account are open
				to the public and can be edited by anyone.</p>
				<p>If you need your evaluations to be kept private, we suggest
				that you create an account.  It is a convenient way to keep your
				evaluations organized and all we need is an email and password.
