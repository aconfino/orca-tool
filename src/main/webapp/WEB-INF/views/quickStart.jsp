					The Open source Rapid Comparitive Analysis tool is designed to help end users to
					 evaluate software and compare strengths and weakness in an easy, repeatable manner.  
					   Instructions are provided as you evaluate the software.  If you encounter a step that
					    requires additional research, you can skip steps and 
					   easily return to them later.  
					   To begin a software evaluation you can click the "begin an evaluation" link at any time.  
					   Common terms used throughout the site are listed below.

				<h3>Terminology</h3>
				<p><b>evaluation</b> - an evaluation contains one to many software surveys.  An evaluation helps you
				organize various software surveys and compare them against each other.</p>
				<p><b>software survey</b> - a survey taken for an individual piece of software (i.e. Apache Maven) to determine 
				if it fits your projects needs</p>
				<p><b>survey metrics</b> - each software survey has 10 metrics that determine the quality of the 
				software in that particular category (support, documentation, code quality, etc).  Metrics are scored as Strong Disagree, 
				Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree</p>
				<p><b>weighting</b> - each metric can be weighted so you can emphasize the metrics that are
				 crucial to your project's success and deemphasize the ones that have minimal impact.  This weighting 
				 is done at the evaluation level so that all software surveys are affected.</p>
				<p><b>reports</b> - once software surveys are complete, you can generate reports and graphs 
				to easily compare up to four surveys at once.</p>
				<p><b>evaluation summary</b> - a summary of all software surveys that belong to that evaluation 
				and their respective scoring.</p>

				<h2>Do I need an account?</h2>
				<p>Nope.  If you are in a hurry and want to start your evaluation,
				there is no need to setup an account.  You can easily reference 
				your evaluation with links that we provide.  Just keep
				in mind, however, that evaluations without an account are open
				to the public and can be edited by anyone.</p>
				<p>If you need your evaluations to be kept private, we suggest
				that you create an account.  It is a convenient way to keep your
				evaluations organized and all we need is an email and password.
